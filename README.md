# CodeAlpha_ML_Task3

**Welcome to the Repository !!!**

In this repository, you will find the source code for machine learning projects Task3 completed during my CodeAlpha internship.

Below is an overview of each project:

**Handwritten Character Recognition**: In this project, a machine learning model was built to recognize handwritten characters. By processing and analyzing handwritten images, this model supports applications in text digitization and character recognition.

o **codealpha_handwritten_character_recognition.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and character recognition.

o **A_Z Handwritten Data.csv:** Dataset used to train and validate the handwritten character recognition model.
